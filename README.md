## hello-world

Hello! My name is Karre (pronounced as common spelling "Carrie"). 
I currently live in Los Angeles and I am passionate about Web Development. 

I am a Full Stack Developer with most experience using the .NET Framework.  
However, I enjoy learning and am happy to pick up any language.  
I enjoy building programs that improve UX (whether internally or on the front end),
I simply enjoy making life easier for others :)

**Please explore my github and feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or by email if you 
believe that I can be of service to you or can collaborate.**
